# MHA Bank



## Introduction
MHA Bank is a Python terminal bank app that runs on the Code Institute's mock terminal Heroku.


MHA Bank stands for Muhammad Hashim Aslam Bank, which is simple bank app.

The app asks for a username at the beginning. If the user already exists, their previous balance will be shown. If not, the app creates a username for them, and then there are four options for them to choose from: deposit, withdraw, view balance, and exit bank.

## Features 

* ### Existing Features

    These are the features were added for users experience.

    * As soon as users open the app, they will see the logo for "MHA Bank" which i created using [pyfiglet module](https://pypi.org/project/pyfiglet/0.7/).

    * User can start the app by typing anything in the input field and then by pressing "Enter" or just simply press "Enter" to start.

    * Users will be asked to enter their username. If they are existing users, just simply input their previous username. If they are new users, they can enter their new username to continue, but the character must not be less than 5 or greater than 10

    * If user is found, the message will show up which says "user found" and their previous balance will shown.

    * When the user chooses option 1 "Deposit," they will be asked to deposit money.  

        Upon depositing, existing users will have their previous account balance updated, and a newly created user will have their details and balance saved.

    * When the user selects option 2 "Withdraw", they will be asked if they would like to withdraw money by choosing one of the option, yes or no. 

      If user press no they will be taken back to options section. 

      If user presses yes, they will be asked how much they would like to withdraw, and they can withdraw by typing the amount.

    * if user tried to withdraw more than their total balance, their transaction will be declined, and they will be notified that their account balance is insufficient.

    * Users can view their balance by selecting option 3 "View Balance".

      If a user is new and has not deposited any funds yet, their balance will be Â£0.

    * Users can exit the app by pressing option 4 "Exit App"

* ### Future Features
    In the future, these are the feathers I would like to add.

    * I would like to add a strict username and password fucntion. If the username or password doesn't match, users won't be able to log in.

    * Keep track of user transactions and display their previous transactions. 

    * I would like to create a transfer money option, where one user can send money to another user.

## Data Model
* I used GoogleSheets to store and retrieve the user's data. Each time the user deposits money or withdraws money, these transactions are stored in the spreadsheet.

## Flowchart

## Validator Testing

* I confirmed that my code passes with no errors using the PEP8 online Python Validator.

## Bugs


* ### Fixed Bugs
    * The first time I made use of the validator, I got too many warnings for "long lines", as well as a "trailing space" warning. Eventually, I managed to fix all of those warnings.

    * Furthermore, I found out that the user could not input dots, so whenever the user tried to input a ".", for example, when the user tried to input Â£10.50, the program would not let him deposit or withdraw money. so I used the replace('.', '') function to fix the issue.

## Deployments
Git and GitHub are used for version control. Python is the backend language, and can't be displayed with GitHub alone, To live preview my project, I used Heroku.

* ### Heroku
    * Deployment steps on Heroku. 

        * Set up a Heroku account (if needed).

        * In the top right corner of the dashboard, click "New" and choose "Create new app."

        * The name of your application must be unique. Click "Create App" after selecting your region.

        * Click the "Settings" tab and scroll down to "Config Vars" on your project page.

        * Enter "PORT" in the KEY input field, followed by "8000" in the VALUE input field and Add the Config Vars by clicking the "Add" button.

        * Add the Python and Node.js buildpacks to the buildpacks section, ensuring that the Python builds are listed above the Node.js builds.


        * Go back to the tabs at the top of the page, then select the "Deploy" tab and choose Github deployment.

        * Then click the "Connect" button to link your repository.

        * Select either Automatic Deployment or Manual Deployment at the bottom of the page. Whenever a project is pushed to Github, Automatic Deployment will deploy it to Heroku. Wait for your project to be deployed.

        * The following steps have been used due to an issue with Heroku's login process: click on "Details" to see what steps have been usedðŸ‘‡<details>IF YOU ARE CREATING A NEW DEPLOYMENT/APP<br><br>
Run the command heroku login -i and login when prompted. Then run the command heroku create your_app_name_here to create a new app, replacing your_app_name_here with the name you want to give your app. This will create a new Heroku app and link it to your Gitpod terminal. You can then access the app via the Heroku dashboard and set up your config vars.<br><br>
IF YOU ALREADY HAVE AN APP CREATED WHICH USES AUTOMATIC DEPLOYS.<br>
Run the command heroku login -i and login when prompted. Then run the following command: heroku git:remote -a your_app_name_here and replace your_app_name_here with the name of your Heroku app. This will link the app to your Gitpod terminal.
Once you have followed the appropriate step above, your Heroku app will be linked to your Gitpod workspace.
HOW TO DEPLOY
After linking your app to your workspace with one of the above steps, you can then deploy new versions of the app by running the command git push heroku main and your app will be deployed to Heroku.</details>



* ### Github
    * Clone the project
        * In order to clone this project, the user must locate the repository Code button on the [MHA-Bank](https://github.com/hashim222/mha-bank) and select either download zip or open with Github Desktop. 
        * A user can copy and paste the link into their git terminal by clicking GitHub CLI and the Copy button in the Code Dropdown menu.


## Credits

* With help from the [Code Institute Love sandwich](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/love-sandwiches-p5-sourcecode) project, I created a function called validate_data() that handles errors.

* The idea of building a bank app with Python comes from a video on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTh-ln2XhgU).

* The site flowchart was created by using [Lucid App](https://lucid.app/documents#/documents?folder_id=home).

* By making this project I had plenty of help from the [Slack Community](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/) and tutor support from Code Institute.

## Acknowledgment
* Throughout this project, Sandeep Aggarwal has been an excellent mentor to me, and I am grateful for his guidance. Also, I want to thank my family members, who all checked out the finished project to see if it worked well and if I could improve it.
